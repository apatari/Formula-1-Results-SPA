# Formula 1 Results Single Page App

This web app was designed to use the Ergast Developer API to display Formula 1 racing results in quick and convenient fashion.  This work was created as part of the Phase 1 final project for the Software Engineering program at the Flatiron School.  In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the app in the most controlled manner possible, information from the Ergast Developer API was stored in the results.json file for ten races.  This means that the library of results is much smaller than what is available in the actual API.  I encourage racing fans and curious developers to check out this wonderful tool on the [Ergast API website](http://ergast.com/mrd/).
